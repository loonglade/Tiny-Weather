## Software
The files found in the folder "<a href="https://github.com/loonglade/Weather/tree/main/mpython">mpython</a>" need to be uploaded onto the microcontroller. Make sure any other files are removed as well; especially "boot.py". I use <a href="https://thonny.org/">Thonny</a> as it is very easy to use.
